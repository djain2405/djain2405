**Mobile Engineering Manager | Hands-on with Android development | Speaker | Builder of Joyful Apps**

Currently leading **Mobile Engineering** at **Quanata**, where I manage a talented team building the **HiRoad Auto Insurance App** 🚘📲. With over **10 years in mobile**, I’ve grown from building Android apps solo to now mentoring engineers, shaping product roadmaps, and scaling apps that impact thousands of users.

While I started as an Android engineer, I’m now on a mission to become a **holistic mobile technologist** — exploring **iOS**, **React Native**, and **SwiftUI**, with a goal to lead full-stack mobile teams across platforms.

### 🌟 What I'm About
- 👩🏽‍💻 **Currently**: Leading mobile engineering on HiRoad – a purpose-driven auto insurance app  
- 🧠 **Exploring**: Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, and mobile architecture patterns  
- 🤝 **Open to collabs**: Have a mobile app idea? Let’s co-create magic  
- 🧭 **Passionate about**: Building delightful user experiences + empowering dev teams  
- 🗣 **Conference Speaker**: Android Makers, Droidcon, DroidKaigi, and more  
- ✍🏽 **Writer**: I blog about my code experiments, tech leadership, and mobile trends
